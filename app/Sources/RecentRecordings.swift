// RecentRecordings — the app's memory of where recordings landed (DIG-795).
//
// A recording is announced once, by a pill that fades in four seconds. After
// that the file is findable only by whoever remembers the `--output` they
// passed. This is the app remembering for them: the last five saves, newest
// first, hanging off the status item.
//
// Recorded at save-time by SessionController, because every session — hotkey,
// CLI, agent — funnels through the same app. There is no second place a
// recording can come from, so there is no second place this has to be wired.
//
// Persisted as JSON next to the control socket rather than in UserDefaults:
// the file is the verification surface (you can cat it after a relaunch and
// see exactly what the menu will show), and cfprefsd's write coalescing makes
// "is it on disk yet?" an unanswerable question in a test.
