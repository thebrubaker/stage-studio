// Permissions — the only place in the app that asks macOS about TCC.
//
// The setup window renders states; this decides what state we are actually in and
// performs the one action that state allows. Kept separate because the mapping
// from "what macOS reports" to "what the user should do" is the whole substance of
// the feature, and it is not obvious:
//
//   * Screen Recording has no API that distinguishes "never asked" from "denied".
//     `CGPreflightScreenCaptureAccess()` returns one Bool. So denial is inferred
//     from the fact that we already asked and still don't have it, which is
//     persisted — because after a denial macOS never prompts this app again, and an
//     `Allow…` button that silently does nothing is precisely the failure the
//     denied state exists to prevent.
//
//   * A Screen Recording grant does not apply to the process that was already
//     running when it arrived. So "granted" is only true if it was granted at
//     LAUNCH; a grant that appeared mid-session is `needsRelaunch`.
//
//   * Microphone is the easy one: AVFoundation reports all four states directly
//     and a grant applies immediately.
//
// Nothing here can revoke anything. There is no `tccutil` and no reset path: the
// only writes are macOS's own consent prompts, and requesting a permission that is
// already granted is a no-op.
