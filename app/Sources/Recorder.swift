// Recorder — a thin supervisor for the EXISTING cmd/recorder binary.
//
// The recorder is not reimplemented here. This app is a second front door onto
// the same proven pipeline the Claude/CLI flow uses, and it speaks the same
// contract src/cli.ts does:
//
//   recorder <windowID> <durationSeconds> <outputPath>
//   env RECORDER_BG_IMAGE=<path to background>
//   duration 0 = open-ended, stop with SIGTERM (5-minute safety cap is built in)
